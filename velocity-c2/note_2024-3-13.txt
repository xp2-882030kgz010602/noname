When I first started this collection, it was because I had found many new and interesting puffer engines and spaceships that weren't in any other collections, and I wanted to list them out. The problem lies in the details. The thing is, different ways to create, say, the same blinker trail at the same period are often still interesting. Trying to list them all at first seems harmless, and it would be, if it were not for the fact that you could perturb a puffer engine in many ways with XWSSes. This is fine for the most part, but what really overwhelmed me was the huge number of puffers you could get by perturbing things like puffer 1, since it's relatively easy to leave behind instances of common objects. Additionally, it's not as simple as just listing out raw puffer engines and orbits without any perturbations. They are rare, but a few puffer engines NEED to be perturbed in order to remain stable, and things like the gliderless 6c/12 MWSS rake deserve to be in the collection and require perturbation to work. Finally, we have volatile engines, whose periods can change in unpredictable ways when perturbed. The fact is that this is still an interesting behavior and that this deserves to be in the collection too. Even ignoring all of this, there are multiple years of things I would have to add in if I wanted to update the collection at this point. I hope that someone else can take over, but this is likely it for me right now.
